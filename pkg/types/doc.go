/*
The `types` package implements variable types which can be used in configurations.
The supported types are `String`, `Duration`, `Int`, `UInt`, `Float`, `Bool` and
`Task`. The `Task` type can either be a reference to a task by name, or instance.
Binding from reference to an instance is done after configurations are parsed.
